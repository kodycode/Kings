# `Kings`

The drinking game 'Kings' turned into a multiplayer game using Colyseus and TypeScript. Inspiration to make this came from covid quarantine lockdown preventing up-close social interactions. Since this game is virtualized, no rules are hard-coded into the logic of the game as I left it open for the players in the game to come up with their rules since some cards and interactions might cause issues (i.e. 4-floor, 7-heaven with webcam lag). The game includes a player list, a card counter to determine what cards have yet to be picked, and a chatroom to speak to other players.
