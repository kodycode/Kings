# `Kings`

The drinking game 'Kings' programmed using Colyseus. Inspiration to make this came from covid quarantine lockdown preventing up-close social interactions. Since this game is virtualized, no rules are hard-coded into the logic of the game as I left it open for the players in the game to come up with their rules since some cards and interactions might cause issues (i.e. 4-floor, 7-heaven with webcam lag).
